        IMPORTANT: Navigate like a human user to avoid rate limiting:
        - Wait 2-3 seconds between actions
        - Scroll naturally to view different parts of the page
        - Don't make rapid consecutive requests
        
        Find the fixtures table with columns: Wk, Day, Date, Time, Home, xG, Score, xG, Away, Attendance, Venue, Referee, Match Report, Notes
        
        Extract data from ALL 380 Premier League matches for the 2024-2025 season from this table:
        
        For each match row, extract:
        1. Gameweek number (column "Wk") 
        2. Home team name (column "Home")
        3. Away team name (column "Away") 
        4. Match report URL (from the "Match Report" column - extract the href link)
        
        IMPORTANT EXTRACTION RULES:
        - Extract ALL 380 matches, not just the visible ones
        - If the table is paginated or has "Show more" functionality, make sure to load all matches
        - For the Match Report URL, extract the full href attribute from the link
        - If a match doesn't have a match report yet (future matches), mark the URL as null
        - Take breaks between scrolling/clicking to avoid rate limiting
        
        Return the data as a JSON array where each match is an object with:
        {
            "gameweek": number,
            "home_team": "string",
            "away_team": "string", 
            "match_report_url": "string or null"
        }
        
        Make sure to include ALL 380 matches from the entire season.
